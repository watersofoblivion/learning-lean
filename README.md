# Learning Lean

A repo for all of my code while learning [Lean 4](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4).  I'm working through a few different sources, some written directly for Lean, but some originally written for [Coq](https://coq.inria.fr/).

Contains code for the following (in various states of completeness):

* [Functional Programming in Lean](https://lean-lang.org/functional_programming_in_lean)
* [Theorem Proving in Lean 4](https://lean-lang.org/theorem_proving_in_lean4)
* [The Natural Number Game (Lean 4)](https://adam.math.hhu.de/#/g/leanprover-community/nng4)
* [The Set Theory Game (Lean 4)](https://adam.math.hhu.de/#/g/djvelleman/stg4)
* [Software Foundations](https://softwarefoundations.cis.upenn.edu/)
  * [Logical Foundations](https://softwarefoundations.cis.upenn.edu/lf-current/index.html)
  * [TODO] [Programming Language Foundations](https://softwarefoundations.cis.upenn.edu/plf-current/index.html)
  * [TODO] [Verified Functional Algorithms](https://softwarefoundations.cis.upenn.edu/vfa-current/index.html)
* [Certified Programming with Dependent Types](http://adam.chlipala.net/cpdt/) ([PDF](http://adam.chlipala.net/cpdt/cpdt.pdf))
* [Types and Programming Languages](https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~bcpierce/tapl/) ([PDF](https://theswissbay.ch/pdf/Gentoomen%20Library/Maths/Comp%20Sci%20Math/Benjamin_C._Pierce-Types_and_Programming_Languages-The_MIT_Press%282002%29.pdf))
